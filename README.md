# Microsoft Studios Film Recommendations

Author: Kevin Gross

## Project Overview

This project analyzes movie studio data to better understand what types of movies generate a larger domestic gross at the box office. The analysis below shows that domestic box office revenues can be linked to specific genres, movie runtimes, and the time of year the movie is released. This information is intended for the head of Microsoft Studios so they can help decide what type of films to create.

### Business Problem

Microsoft is seeing all the big companies create original video content and have decided that this is a revenue stream that they want to attempt to tap into. Their first thought is to create a new movie studio, but they do not know anything about creating movies. The information below explores what types of films are doing best at the box office and translates those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft Studios can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

This analysis looks at a few different data sets:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

### Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis to help formulate 3 concrete business recommendations for the head of Microsoft's new movie studio. Since all of the data contained information from different time periods, this analysis focuses on when all of the datasets overlap, which is from 2010 to 2018.
